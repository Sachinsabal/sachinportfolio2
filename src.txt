Good career guidance plays a crucial role in shaping students' futures, including those considering a career in teaching. Here are some key points:

1. **Inspiring Aspirations**: Good career guidance inspires pupils by helping them understand the world of work and the skills needed to succeed¬≥.

2. **Avoiding Assumptions**: It avoids assumptions about limits on a young person's options, recognizing that different subjects may open various doors‚Åµ.

3. **Raising Aspirations**: It encourages aiming high and recognizing that some subjects may seem harder but can lead to broader opportunities‚Åµ.

4. **Career in Teaching**: If you're interested in teaching, it offers the chance to make a difference in students' lives, job stability, growth potential, and diversity in work settings and subject areas¬≤.

Remember, quality career guidance helps students make informed decisions and realize their potential. üòä
